    "**This code defines a dictionary called `sample_data` that represents data related to a group of employees and their work-related preferences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **employee_names**: A list of 12 employee names\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **date_hired**: A list of dates indicating when each of these employees was hired.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **availability**: This is a list where each item is another list. Each inner list indicates the days of the week an employee is available to work. All employees in this sample data are available from Monday to Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **shift_type**: A list representing the shift preferences of each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **preferred_location**: A list indicating the preferred work location of each employee. It includes options 'Location A' and 'Location B'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating database file:\n",
    "1. It takes the data in the `sample_data` dictionary and converts it into a `DataFrame` object using `pandas`. The result is stored in the variable `df`.\n",
    "2. The code then checks if a file named `employees.csv` exists in the current working directory.\n",
    "3. If the file does not already exist, the data in `df` (which came from `sample_data`) is saved to a new CSV file named `employees.csv`. The `index=False` argument ensures that the DataFrame's index (row numbers) is not written to the CSV file."

    "#### Important Notes: \n",
    "- Dates should be stored as YYYY-MM-DD for SQL databases\n",
    "- If you don't want to use SQL commands to navigate data, use python's built in pandas functions after creating the DataFrame\n",
    "- Python's sorting function should look like --> sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='date_hired')\n",
    "- It's easier to query directly when calling the database table that you are reading from"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "1. **`fix_date_format()` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function reads employee data from a CSV file named `employees.csv`.\n",
    "    - It identifies any dates in the `date_hired` column that are not in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' and then converts those dates to the desired format.\n",
    "    - Finally, it writes (overwrites) the modified DataFrame back into the `employees.csv` file and returns the updated DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`sort_data_by_date_hired()` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function reads the employee data from the `employees.csv` file.\n",
    "    - It then sorts this data based on the `date_hired` column in ascending order.\n",
    "    - The sorted data is written back (overwritten) into the `employees.csv` file, and the sorted DataFrame is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`modify_sample_data(df)` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function takes a DataFrame `df` as its argument, and it starts by displaying the DataFrame in a tabulated format.\n",
    "    - The user is prompted to enter the index of the employee they wish to modify or press 'q' to exit.\n",
    "    - If the user decides to modify an entry, they are provided with a list of attributes/columns that they can choose to modify.\n",
    "    - Depending on the selected attribute, the user is prompted to provide the new data:\n",
    "        - For `availability`, the user is prompted to provide days as a comma-separated list without spaces.\n",
    "        - For `shift_type`, the user can enter 'day' or 'swing'.\n",
    "        - For `preferred_location`, the user can enter one of the location names.\n",
    "        - For `date_hired`, the user should provide the date in the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n",
    "    - After inputting the desired change, the user is asked for confirmation. If the user confirms, the change is made, and the updated data is written back to the `employees.csv` file. If not, no changes are made.\n",
    "Certainly! Here's a brief overview of what the provided code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`send_employees_message_via_twilio(schedule_text, to_number)` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function sends a text message using the Twilio API.\n",
    "    - It requires the recipient's phone number (`to_number`) and the message content (`schedule_text`).\n",
    "    - The function uses the Twilio account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio-provided phone number to authenticate and send the message.\n",
    "    - After sending the message, it prints the message SID (a unique ID provided by Twilio) along with the recipient's number to confirm the message was sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`next_mondays_date()` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function returns the date for the next upcoming Monday.\n",
    "    - It calculates the number of days from today until the next Monday and then adds that to today's date.\n",
    "    - The resulting date is formatted as 'MM-DD-YYYY' and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`three_weeks_from_next_mondays_date()` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function returns the date exactly three weeks from the next Monday.\n",
    "    - It first determines the date of the next Monday using the `next_mondays_date()` function and then adds 3 weeks (21 days) to that date.\n",
    "    - The resulting date is formatted as 'MM-DD-YYYY' and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`merge_and_print_schedule(day_schedule, swing_schedule, location)` Function**:\n",
    "    - This function takes in two DataFrames (`day_schedule` and `swing_schedule`), which represent employee schedules for day and swing shifts, respectively.\n",
    "    - A new column 'Shift' is added to each schedule to indicate if it's a day or swing shift.\n",
    "    - The function then concatenates the two schedules to form a single DataFrame.\n",
    "    - This merged DataFrame is then reordered to make the 'Shift' column appear first.\n",
    "    - Finally, the DataFrame is converted into a visually appealing table format using the `tabulate` function. The table represents the combined schedule for a specific location (`location`), with each row indicating the employee scheduled for that day and shift type.\n",
    "    - The formatted table string is then returned."
